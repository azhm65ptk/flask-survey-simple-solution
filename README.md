# flask-survey-simple-solution

This is a survey application building with flask.
At the begining, it is an empty list and the answers will store to that list

It will ask the site visitor questions from a questionnaire, one per screen, moving to the next question when they submit.
This is still buggy becasue  Visitors need to answer the question
There’s no way to reset the survey. Once it’s complete, you can only see the start page and the thank you page.
(Stop and rerun the server again from command line) to begin again. ie. flask run (again)
